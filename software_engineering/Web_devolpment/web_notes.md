# Why should a data scientist learn web development?

In this course, you are going to use Flask to build a data dashboard. You might be thinking that you already have good tools for visualizing data such as matplotlib, seaborn, or Tableau.

However, the web development skills you'll learn in this lesson will prepare you for building other types of data science applications. Data scientists are increasingly being asked to deploy their work as an application in the cloud.

For example, consider a project where you build a model that classifies disaster relief messages into categories. With your web development skills, you could turn that model into a web app where you would input a message and display the resulting message category.

As another example, consider a system that recommends movies based on a user's preferences. Part of the recommendation engine could include a web application that displays recommended products based on a userid. What you learn in this course will set you up for building the web app portion of the recommendation engine.

# How to Think about This Lesson

The lesson first gives an overview of the three base languages for web development: html, css, and JavaScript. You could take an entire course just on each of these languages. The goal is for you to get comfortable writing at least some code in each language so that you understand the web template files at the end of the lesson. This lesson goes through a lot of information to get you up to speed.

To work with the web template and make a data dashboard, you will only need to write Python code. If you want to customize the dashboard, you can do so with just a few changes to the html code. But the underlying technologies of data dashboard will be css, html, JavaScript, and Python.

## Lesson Files
All of the lesson's exercises are contained in classroom workspaces. You'll even deploy a web app from the classroom workspace; however, if you prefer to work locally, you can find the lesson files in this [data scientist nanodegree GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/DSND_Term2/tree/master/lessons/WebDevelopment).
