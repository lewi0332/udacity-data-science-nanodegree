    "Using the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, this project is an opportunity to explore and analyze data ecommerce data from Google Analytics 360 exported to BigQuery from the Google Merchandise Store.\n",

    "\n",
    "As an e-commerce store, much of the marketing resources are spent attracting potential customers through digital means. Using tools such as affliate marketing, display ads, and paid search terms are industry standard methods of bring new potential buyers. Our digital world is being being bifurcated into iOS and Android. Apple has recently begun to differentiate itself among the big four (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon) as the one who champions privacy. Safari users now see less-targeted ads, the App Store is increasing the scrutiny on how an iOS app is allowed to collect data and consumers are given easy choices, often by default, about disallowing cookies, location and other trackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with those measures, are Apple users less inclined to be driven to purchase from ads?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this information may drive the business to adjust decisions on how or where to spend marketing dollars attracting nw customers. Our objective is to increase the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Whether that means a reduction in spending targeted to Apple users or an increase in spending to another demographic that *is* afffected by targeted advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I will attempt to answer the following questions to meet our business objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do macOS/iOS affected by traffic source in the same way... organic, paid display. Are targeted ads less effective on iOS? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do macOS/iOS users purchase more than windows/android users?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation of refering traffic to higher average order value?\n",

    "One major flaw of this analysis is that the volume of impressions is not known. The Google Merchandise Store may have purchased more advertisements targeted at mobile device users resulting in higher traffic from those Operating Systems. However, we can see that Android and iOS users are coming to the site from paid ads at nearly the same rate. Again, it is possible that the Google Merchandise Store purchased more targeted ad impressions to one group or another in order to realize the same site traffic volume. In a real world scenario working inside an organization, the effectiveness of the impressions converting to traffic would be a obvious metric to track.\n",

    "It’s very important to remember that this data is now nearly 5 years old. A lot has happened in the world of digital advertising, mobile purchasing and the change in marketshare of the OS leaders. While it is interesting to be able to explore and analyze free public data from Google Analytics 360 on BigQuery, the missing pieces regarding original ad impressions and the specifics of purchase data keep this analysis from becoming truly useful.\n",

    "That said, regarding the question of effectiveness of digital advertising on Apple users, it looks as though Display Ads, Affiliates, and Paid Search are just as effective at driving traffic, converting to sales and increasing order size for Apple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw conversion rate nearly double for all OS groups when coming from paid sources. And, percentage of traffic from paid sources was very similar across most of the OS options. Therefore, no OS could be correlated with less traffic (assuming the original ad-buy was similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the end, product is king. The biggest source of revenue found the products organically and from their macOS equipped machine. For all the money and effort put into digital advertising in this case we are not able to directly relate these purchases to the investment. We do learn, however, which group is most likely to buy. Perhaps we can use this information to help plan product development and ad buys in the future.\n"
