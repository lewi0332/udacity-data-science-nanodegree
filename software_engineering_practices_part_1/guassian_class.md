# Gaussian Class

### Resources for Review

The example in the next part of the lesson assumes you are familiar with Gaussian and binomial distributions.

Here are a few formulas that might be helpful:

**Gaussian Distribution Formulas**

probability density function

\\(f(x \space | \space \mu, \sigma^2) \\)

= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}f(x ∣ μ,σ 2) = 2πσ 21e −2σ 2 (x−μ) 2 \begin{aligned} \\ 

\\( \text{where:} \\ \mu& \space \text{is the mean} \\ \sigma& \space \text{ is the standard deviation} \\ \sigma&^2 \space \text{is the variance} \end{aligned} \\)


where:
μ is the mean 
σ is the standard deviation
σ2 is the variance
​	 
  

**Binomial Distribution Formulas**
mean

\mu = n * pμ=n∗p

In other words, a fair coin has a probability of a positive outcome (heads) p = 0.5. If you flip a coin 20 times, the mean would be 20 * 0.5 = 10; you'd expect to get 10 heads.

variance

\sigma^2 = n * p * (1 - p)σ 
2
 =n∗p∗(1−p)

Continuing with the coin example, n would be the number of coin tosses and p would be the probability of getting heads.

**standard deviation**

\sigma = \sqrt{n * p * (1 - p)} σ= n∗p∗(1−p)
​	 

or in other words, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

**probability density function**

f(k, n, p) = \frac{n\footnotesize{!}}{k!(n - k)!}p^k(1-p)^{(n-k)}f(k,n,p) = k!(n−k)! n! p k (1−p) (n−k)

If you would like to review the Gaussian (normal) distribution and binomial distribution, here are a few resources:

This free Udacity course, [Intro to Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101), has a lesson on Gaussian distributions as well as the Binomial distribution.

This free course, [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827), also has a Gaussian distributions lesson.
